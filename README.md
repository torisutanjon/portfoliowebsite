# My Name is Tristan John P. Girao

- I created this website to serve as my Portfolio.
- Here you can see what kind of person I think I am.
- And almost everything that I can share of myself.

## The website consists of 3 parts.

### 1. The Landing Page

First thing you will see when you open the website

### 2. About Me Page

This section where I explain why I started programming and why I like it.

### 3. My Portfolio Page

This is where you can see my current repositories in Github and some technologies I tried and currently using.
